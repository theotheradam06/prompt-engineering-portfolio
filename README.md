# Introduction

**Who I Am**  
I’m Adam (theotheradam06), a Vanderbilt-certified prompt engineer. Over the past weeks I’ve mastered a wide spectrum of techniques for guiding large language models—driving them to reason, compose, and act.

**My Mission**  
To craft robust, reliable prompts that unlock LLMs’ full potential—across chat, code, knowledge retrieval, and creative generation.
